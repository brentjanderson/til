# Phone systems crash

Today I learned that phone systems crash, and sometimes they crash in really frustrating ways.
Our switchvox system has turfed it pretty badly, and not having direct access to the
guts of the system has made it difficult to troubleshoot and support it. That said,
phone systems in general seem to suck pretty bad. There's a lot of complexity and a lot
of nuance, and there does not seem to be much in the way of making it more clean and
elegant, outside of using an abstraction from a 3rd party, like Twilio or Plivo.

I've spent way too much time trying to fix this system.
