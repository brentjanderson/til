# Culture eats strategy for breakfast

Working at BlenderBottle has helped me realize just how great I have it:
I work at a company that seeks to empower employees, pays well, and
is constantly innovating every element of itself. Culture, products, 
process, technology - you name it. I love that we really do "challenge

Essentially, culture is a key component of long-term strategy. You have to
design it and invest in it, just as you would the user interface or experience
of your product. If you don't do culture, you won't get great talent, and you
will find yourself struggling sooner and in more structural ways than you'd expect.

That said, if you're not profitable, you're not going to serve customers or 
employees. You have to have the whole picture in order to succeed.
